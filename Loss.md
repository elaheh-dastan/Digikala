# MSE
It penalizes larger errors more heavily because of the squaring.

Sensitive to outliers

# MAE
- More robust to outliers than MSE.
- Has the same unit as the target variable (makes interpretation easier).

# R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)
R² tells you how much of the variance in the target variable is explained by your model.

# Cross Entropy, Cosine Similarity, Logit  Scale
## Cross Entropy
Used for:
→ Classification tasks (predicting discrete categories like “electronics”, “clothing”, etc.)

What it measures:
→ How far the predicted probability distribution is from the true class distribution.
